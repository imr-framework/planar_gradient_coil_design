# planar_gradient_coil_design

This project contains tools for designing planar gradient coils for MRI applications. The design process is implemented in the `amri_design_planar_gradient_coil.py` script.

## Features

- **Customizable Coil Design**: Generate planar gradient coil designs tailored to specific requirements.
- **Optimization Algorithms**: Includes methods for optimizing coil performance.
- **Visualization Tools**: Plot and analyze the generated coil patterns.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd planar_gradient_coil_design
    ```

2. Run the design script:
    ```bash
    python amri_design_planar_gradient_coil.py --help
    ```

    Use the `--help` flag to view available options and parameters.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`

Install dependencies using:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Example

To design a planar gradient coil with default parameters:
```bash
python amri_design_planar_gradient_coil.py
```
